### Relations and Attributes for Electronic Seals (E-Seals)

1. **E-Seal**

   - **SealID**: Unique identifier for each e-seal.
   - **SealType**: Type of e-seal (e.g., reusable, disposable).
   - **Status**: Current status (e.g., active, tampered, inactive).
   - **InstallationDate**: Date when the e-seal was installed.
   - **LastInspectionDate**: Date of the last inspection.
   - **Location**: Current location of the e-seal.
   - **BatteryLevel**: Current battery level of the e-seal.
   - **TamperAlerts**: Number of tamper alerts triggered.

2. **Container**

   - **ContainerID**: Unique identifier for each container.
   - **SealID**: Foreign key linking to the E-Seal table.
   - **Owner**: Owner of the container.
   - **Contents**: Description of the contents.
   - **Destination**: Destination of the container.
   - **CurrentLocation**: Current location of the container.

3. **InspectionLog**
   - **LogID**: Unique identifier for each inspection log.
   - **SealID**: Foreign key linking to the E-Seal table.
   - **InspectorID**: Identifier for the inspector.
   - **InspectionDate**: Date of the inspection.
   - **Notes**: Notes from the inspection.

### Relations and Attributes for RFID Systems

1. **RFIDTag**

   - **TagID**: Unique identifier for each RFID tag.
   - **TagType**: Type of RFID tag (e.g., passive, active).

     - 1. **Passive RFID Tags**:

       - **No Internal Power Source**: These tags do not have their own power source. They rely on the energy transmitted by the RFID reader to power up and send back their data.
       - **Shorter Range**: Typically, passive tags have a shorter read range, usually up to a few meters.
       - **Cost-Effective**: They are generally cheaper and smaller, making them suitable for many applications like inventory tracking, access control, and asset management.

       - 2. **Active RFID Tags**:
         - **Internal Power Source**: These tags have their own battery, which allows them to transmit signals independently of the RFID reader.
         - **Longer Range**: Active tags can be read from much greater distances, sometimes up to hundreds of meters.
         - **More Expensive**: They are usually more expensive due to the battery and additional components, and are used in applications requiring long-range tracking, such as in logistics and large-scale asset tracking.

   - **Status**: Current status (e.g., active, inactive).
   - **InstallationDate**: Date when the RFID tag was installed.
   - **LastReadDate**: Date when the tag was last read.
   - **Location**: Current location of the RFID tag.

2. **Asset**

   - **AssetID**: Unique identifier for each asset.
   - **TagID**: Foreign key linking to the RFIDTag table.
   - **Description**: Description of the asset.
   - **Owner**: Owner of the asset.
   - **Location**: Current location of the asset.
   - **Status**: Current status of the asset (e.g., in transit, in storage).

3. **ReadLog**
   - **LogID**: Unique identifier for each read log.
   - **TagID**: Foreign key linking to the RFIDTag table.
   - **ReaderID**: Identifier for the RFID reader.
   - **ReadDate**: Date when the tag was read.
   - **Location**: Location where the tag was read.
   - **SignalStrength**: Signal strength of the read.

These relations and attributes should help you design a robust database for managing electronic seals and RFID systems. If you need more specific details or have any questions, feel free to ask!
